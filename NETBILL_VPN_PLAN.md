# NETBILL VPN - Android VPN App Development Plan

## Information Gathered
- User wants a fully functional Android VPN app named "NETBILL VPN".
- Features similar to HTTP Injector and HTTP Custom.
- Core functionality includes VPN tunneling, HTTP header injection, SSH tunneling, payload customization, and user-friendly UI.
- The app should be installable on Android phones.

## Proposed Technology Stack
- Android native development using Kotlin (preferred) or Java.
- Use Android's VpnService API for VPN tunneling.
- Use OkHttp or similar libraries for HTTP requests and custom headers.
- Use SSHJ or JSch library for SSH tunneling.
- UI built with Android Jetpack components (ViewModel, LiveData, etc.).
- Gradle for build and dependency management.

## Main Features
- VPN tunneling using Android VpnService.
- Custom HTTP header injection and payload configuration.
- SSH tunneling support with authentication.
- Config file import/export (e.g., .json or custom format).
- Connection status and logs display.
- User-friendly UI for configuration and connection control.
- Background service to maintain VPN connection.
- Notifications for connection status.
- Optionally, support for payload generation and advanced settings.

## Project Structure
- /app
  - /src/main/java/com/netbillvpn
    - MainActivity.kt (UI entry point)
    - VpnServiceManager.kt (manages VPN connection)
    - HttpInjector.kt (handles HTTP injection)
    - SshTunnel.kt (manages SSH tunneling)
    - ConfigManager.kt (handles config import/export)
    - Logger.kt (logging utility)
  - /res
    - layout files (activity_main.xml, etc.)
    - drawable resources
    - values (strings.xml, colors.xml, styles.xml)
- build.gradle (app and project level)
- AndroidManifest.xml (declare VpnService and permissions)

## Dependencies
- Kotlin stdlib
- AndroidX libraries
- OkHttp for HTTP handling
- SSHJ or JSch for SSH tunneling
- Coroutine libraries for async operations

## Follow-up Steps After Plan Approval
- Initialize Android Studio project with the above structure.
- Implement core VPN service using VpnService API.
- Develop UI for connection management.
- Implement HTTP injection and SSH tunneling modules.
- Test on Android emulator and real devices.
- Package APK for installation.

Please confirm if this plan meets your expectations or if you want to add/remove any features before I start implementation.
